The Ganga River, also known as the Ganges, is one of the most sacred and revered rivers in India. Originating from the Gangotri Glacier in the Himalayas, it flows through northern India and into Bangladesh, ultimately emptying into the Bay of Bengal. The Ganga holds immense cultural and religious significance for Hindus, who consider it a goddess and believe that bathing in its holy waters cleanses sins and brings spiritual purification. The river sustains the livelihoods of millions of people and supports diverse ecosystems. However, the Ganga faces significant pollution challenges due to industrial waste, sewage, and religious rituals. Efforts are being made to clean and rejuvenate the river, aiming to preserve its ecological and cultural importance.
